**<u>READ THIS FIRST</u>**

Everything you see here is everything about me. Read anything that you are Interested in, feel free to skip the one that's not relevant for you to understand who really am I. There's not much "codes" or "programming languages I know" going on here, but there's lots of my true thoughts that I have concluded for myself. This is what I believe an "about me" should have. Hope this get you to understand me a little more.

### IT/CS Related

This is a big part of my life, almost half of my life has been programming.

#### Why do I like Computer Stuff? My Introduction on Programming and Software Related

> It's enjoyable to see something, and you expect it to work, and it actually works

This all started first came to Malaysia when I had no friend due to language barrier, and my parents are busy. This is when I had my parent's laptop as my friend.

Without an Internet connection, all I did (and i enjoined doing) was to explore the computer settings. From changing the wallpaper to setting up a new user account (I was still in Kindergarten).

>  Exploration is fun, If you see a button that you don't know what it does, just click it and see what happens

It was still Windows XP, when everything of the system which you can change is found in a folder called "Control Panel", I kind of clicked everything I can in that "Control Panel" and see what happens. I kind of developed a skill which allows me to predict what would happen when I click something.

> I understand how this works now! I think i can change it and make it looks just a little different from other people's

It seems that I have understand how windows works better then anyone else at my age that time, or even people at my parents age, I was able to change icon of different file type (File Type Association), How to customize my task-bar and my start menu to make it looks like Windows 2000. I have explored the C:\Windows directory and System32 Directory, and have a basic understand how command line works in Windows.

> Wait, was that my first piece of code?

My first touch to "programming" was exploring Microsoft Access (I didn't know that was something called "database" at the time). In Microsoft Access, you can create forms to manage your data in a table, and create VB Functions that automates things. It was at the same time, I came across a tutorial of making a login form in VB. So I made my first login form by a simple If statement.

```VB
IF textbox1.text = "frankie" AND textbox2.text = "1234" THEN
    msgbox("Login Successed!")
ELSE
    msgbox("Login Failed!")
```

I didn't realize that this is programming until someone in the same school told me that this actually **is** programming and coding
(Our school came with both Primary Section and Secondary Section)

> Some best times in my life

This was in primary school, when I still have plenty of time to explore this without worrying my Science Results or if I can write Chinese Words correctly. 
I started to learn lots of fun programming things with the friend I made (the one told me that I write codes).

I learned how to use Google in the correct way, this kind of helps me a lot in exploring IT related things.

At this point, I'm just simply excited about coding. I would spend hours and hours to understand how something works and see if I can make a similar one just by my self.

This continues until now, but I kind of have a direction to work on now.

#### What I Have Done (or currently working on)

Here are projects I worked on (Personal projects). They are all based on my hobby, most of them are unfinished.

- **The Fr-sh Project** (Working on)

  Fr-sh is a interpretive shell and shell language for scripting for the Linux operating system. [Github Repo](https://www.github.com/mclt0568/fr-sh-remade)

  The main idea of Fr-sh is to improve the current Bash and Zsh Syntax. Ideas including:

  - Adding Data types to Variables
  - A Better way to access or pipe the stdio/ fileio and return code of processes
  - Improved syntax of special statements (such as If, While, For)
  - Supports Extension and Theme Developments (You can write extensions to this bash to customize it)
  - A set of organized, easy-to-use tool to manipulate string, makes it easy to use to write scripts automate file modifications
- Support Error Handling and Exceptions when Scripting
  
- Keeps key features of Bash so it's easy to use for people who is used to Bash and Zsh
  
- **A multi-purpose chat-bot for Discord** (Old project. Not on Github)

  Discord is a chatting app, and it has an API to create chat-bot that can listen to your message and respond to you

  The bot is able to:

  - Look up weather
    - It checks for keywords in your sentence such as "weather", "humidity", "temperature" and "what", "how", "check" etc
    - If it detect those keywords, it will search your sentence to google and get the HTML for weather information
    - Then it will use regex to filter out the necessary information, and format it into a readable form, then send it to the chat of the app
  - Translation, Language Detection
    - Uses Google Translate Python API
  - Timer and Countdowns
    - checks for keywords like "count to", "countdown", "alarm" and extract the number, units such as "30 minuts", "20 seconds"
    - count down and sends a message to remind you when its timeup
  - Other things like math calculations
    - Calculate simple math by using `eval()` function in Python
    - Calculates Simultaneous Equation with a given ax^2+bx=c
- **Other Small Projects** (Mostly Discontinued, Maybe I should find sometime to continue them)

#### What am I Interested in Next

- IOT
- UI Design and UX Improvement (Atleast for Windows)

#### What do I Want to Learn and Expect Myself to Get Good In

- Learn how to work with people
- Learn to contribute in an opensource project to improve it
- Learn the standards of software development
